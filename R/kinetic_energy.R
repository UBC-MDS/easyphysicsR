#' Kinetic Energy
#'
#' Calculates the Kinetic Energy of an object. When work is done on an object, energy is transferred, and the object moves with a new constant speed. We call the energy that is transferred kinetic energy, and it depends on the mass and speed achieved. The kinetic energy equation is given as: KE = 1/2*m*v^2, where KE is the kinetic energy, m is the body’s mass, and v is the body’s velocity.
